## Password Generator

#### Web Version
I developed an online password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web-based tool enables users to generate highly secure and customizable passwords. Users can specify the password length and character sets to meet their specific security requirements.

#### Desktop Version (Electron)
I created a desktop version of the password generator using the Electron framework. This cross-platform desktop application is built with web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides the same password generation capabilities as the web version, offering a secure and convenient solution for managing passwords on users' local machines.
